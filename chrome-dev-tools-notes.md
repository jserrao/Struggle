Chrome Dev Tool Notes
========

## Ch 1: Element Panel

* On Mac OSX, the keyboard command to open the 
`Option + Command + I`
* *Edit as HTML* on the HTML element window allows you to just go buckwild on editing the whole HTML document
* *Delete Node* takes out a piece of HTML

## Ch 2: Style Panel
* + button in the panel adds a new style
* window icon accesses the world of pseudo classes if you want that
* clicking on color swatch in CSS panel pulls up a color selector

## Ch 3: Sources
* You can save/export your changes, just right click the sources panel and select *Save As*
* Right-click on Sources window to see your change history with *Local Modifcations*
* You can get rid of changes with *Apply Original Content* or Revert the whole doc with *Revert* link

## Ch 4: Console
* It's just a place to drop Javascript code - go nuts
* Debugging is based around using console.log, like normal JS debugging
* If you dig into the console.log(console) tree - you get a whole bunch of debugging function options (like assert)
