Struggle - Learning Logic-Based Programming (Javascript)
========

I've long been a front-end developer with pretty lousy javascript skills - it's been a stuggle - so I'm starting over from scratch and learning this thing from the ground up. And this is just where I'm just cribbing some notes from my existence, dont mind me. 

Maybe you too would like to stand between the people and the machines?


What Do I Need to Be a Part of This?
-----

You need some background in web technology and light programming before tackling this. If you can use github, you're probably already fine. Here are some tools I will be using and a quick rationale behind their use.

Links to the Goods:
* Full understanding of HTML markup
* CSS and the preprocessor [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - the way to style things
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book) - version control, the gold standard (but you're on github so you already know that :)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) - My go-to text editor
* [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com) - My terminal (OSX)

Optional:
* At least some familiarity with the concept of a client-side (JS) versus server-side (almost everything else) scripting language
* Hopefully you've manipulated the DOM with [jQuery](http://jquery.com) at some point (an accordion or fade perhaps?)
* Basic use of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) (which contains Bower / Grunt) - I'm using these to scaffold out my JS app
* [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) - this is the JS MVC framework I'm going with but you could probably use Angular and get by.

Methods
-----

I'm tackling this using a variety of resources:
* Step 1: Complete the first three steps in [Chrome Dev Tools, In-depth on Code School](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/)
* Step 2: Read Chapters 1 + 2 + 3 in [Professional Javascript for Web Developers by Nicholas C. Zakas](http://m.friendfeed-media.com/95a8434720c64a63e96ff8c4364fb595d9e98c36)

If you have questions, hit me up via github and I'm sure we can sort it out.


What Does This Repo Do?
-----

Nothing except that it shows you the steps I'm going through to learn JS.


How Can I Contribute?
-----

I'd probably recommend forking it and using this repo as a template to guide your studies. You can send me some pull requests if you have an idea on how to improve this.
