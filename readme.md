Struggle - Learning Logic-Based Programming (Javascript)
========

I've long been a front-end developer with pretty lousy javascript skills - it's been a stuggle - so I'm starting over from scratch and learning this thing from the ground up. And this is just where I'm just cribbing some notes from my existence, dont mind me. 

Maybe you too would like to stand between the people and the machines?


What Do I Need to Be a Part of This?
-----

You need some background in web technology and light programming before tackling this. If you can use github, you're probably already fine. Here are some tools I will be using and a quick rationale behind their use.

Links to the Goods:
* Full understanding of HTML markup
* CSS and the preprocessor [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - the way to style things
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book) - version control, the gold standard (but you're on github so you already know that :)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) - My go-to text editor
* [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com) - My terminal (OSX)

Optional:
* At least some familiarity with the concept of a client-side (JS) versus server-side (almost everything else) scripting language
* Hopefully you've manipulated the DOM with [jQuery](http://jquery.com) at some point (an accordion or fade perhaps?)
* Basic use of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) (which contains Bower / Grunt) - I'm using these to scaffold out my JS app
* [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) - this is the JS MVC framework I'm going with but you could probably use Angular and get by.

Methods
-----

I'm tackling this using a variety of resources:

### Week 1

* Complete the first three steps in [Chrome Dev Tools, In-depth on Code School](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/). This will help you be able to use the console in Chrome effectively for testing sample code.
* Read the Intro of [Eloquent JS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/preview/). Really good high level overview here.
* Watch some of [Douglas Crawford's JS videos](http://yuiblog.com/crockford/) - Probably 1 & 2 to start. 
* Read Chapters 1 + 2 [Professional Javascript for Web Developers by Nicholas C. Zakas](http://it-ebooks.info/book/483/). This is heavy stuff, go slow and take lots of notes.


### Week 2



### TBD

* As I get to it.



Good Resources

* Great intro to [Objects on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)
* [JS Closures](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work?rq=1) explained on Stack Overflow
* This book is supposed to be good [DOM Enlightenment](http://www.domenlightenment.com/), havent looked at it yet
* Good resource / inspiration for organizing my learning here [Learn JS Six Week Class on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2179b5/learn_javascript_properly_omnibus_post_for_the/)
* [Best Resource for Learning JS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11246/best-resources-to-learn-javascript)
* Once you get a good handle on JS, this book mixes in jQuery quite heavily [Javascript, the Missing Manual](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596515898)
* A Way to Learn Javascript syntax by repair code via tests: [Javascript Koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)


How Can I Contribute?

I'd probably recommend forking it and using this repo as a template to guide your studies. You can send me some pull requests if you have an idea on how to improve this.
