# Struggle - A Program for Aspiring Digital Professionals

Struggle is a program that quickly teaches you how to be a digital professional, filling major gaps in the educational cannon.

* Typical coursework is focused on depth of knowledge. Struggle is focused on giving you the big picture as fast as possible. Speed is the primary feature of Struggle.

* Most digital coursework makes the assumption that you know which digital skill you want to learn. Struggle assumes you don't fully understand the digital landscape, so we introduce you to all the digital disciplines.

* Courses typically focus on a single subject. Struggle focuses on entire field.

Struggle is a compendium of knowledge from my 10+ years of experience in various digital trenches around the internet. I hope other professionals contribute their wisdom to it. Everything produced here is freely available for you to copy and use as you see fit.

## What Do I Need to Be a Part of This?

The prerequisites for this course are very low. Think of it as a 101 course. But we are going to talk about technical concepts so you need some degree of digital aptitude. Creating and not just consuming on the web is a good starting place. Light programming skills would benefit you tremendously but aren't required.
