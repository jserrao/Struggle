# Management 

Software development is detail-oriented, technical work that scares many people. Humans inherently fear the unknown and the digital world fits into that category for most people you will work with. Effectively managing digital deliverables is about mitigating this fear with organization, participation and flexibility.

The process for digital delivery is broken into two main groups: waterfall and agile project management methodologies. 

## Waterfall

*Waterfall methodology* gets its name from the cascading phases that get completed during each project (the cascade forms a waterfall when viewed as a timeline). These projects are laid out into distinct phases (architecture, design, content, etc) with the full scope of features predetermined *before* the project begins. 

Each phase acts as a dependency for the phase that follows (ie, architecture is required to start design, and design is required to start development). Waterfall methods pair with simplier development projects because their requirements are limited enough to fit into a rigid scope.

## Agile

*Agile methodology* gives into the chaos of the digital world a bit more by assuming that a project's end goals will shift *while* the project is being completed. To achieve this level of flexibility, an agile project creates periods of work called sprints. Each sprint generally runs about two weeks and is planned from a list of desired features called the backlog that the project manager maintains. 

Predetermined stakeholders in the project will meet with the project manager before each sprint begins to organize which tasks will be completed. Normally 10-15 of the highest priority, fully-speced tasks from the backlog are implemented within a sprint. 

## Comparing Waterfall and Agile Methods

Sprints mix design, content, architecture and development tasks on an inderdisciplinary team. This is beneficial for a large project because inter-departmental tasks that block progress in strict waterfall phases can be addressed iteratively each sprint in an agile project. 

The amount of work that can be completed using an agile model is the project's velocity. Because an agile project could theoretically continue forever, the velocity becomes a gauge to measure productivity between sprints. In watefall projects, progress is typically evaluated in a post-morteum meeting at the culmination of work.  

In practice, each of these methodologies are often modified to suit the needs of a project. A common scenario for many agencies is that they want to use agile methods to accelerate delivery but clients will only pay for a static feature set delivered all at once with a waterfall method. 

## Continuous Integration

Agile methods for developers can be extended further with a technique called *Continuous Integration (CI)*. On these projects, developers check in code to a repository multiple times a day and that code is automatically tested by a build tool. This method of coding allows for the most rapid feature release schedule but setting up the necessary tests in the build scripts is very time consuming. Because of this, CI only makes sense on durable codebases that will receive years of contributions.

## Pro Tips

* Many non-technical stakeholders in a project will wrongly assume that they can do content, design and architecture tasks. But they will almost never assume this about development tasks. As such, content, design and architecture deliverables will be poured over extensively by non-technical personnel while development deliverables are rarely if ever checked outside of the technical team.

* Most non-technical stakeholders need to feel like they are contributing to the digital product but lack the skills to do so. This often manifests as a fixation on non-critical features a certain stakeholder can grasp. This behavior can do great damage to a project if not contained. To mitigate this problem, give non-technical stakeholders non-technical decision points to make during each sprint.

* Watefall projects are at especially high risk for momentum losses and discouraged participants because non-technical stakeholders tend to disengage whenever the crucial development stage is underway. If the feature requests of a project are sufficiently large such that development may take over 6-8 weeks, waterfall methods should not be used to mitigate this problem.

* Agile projects have many benefits for the working teams that build digital products but can be unsettling for stakeholders that have to foot the bill. Spending time up front to show how an agile project can better engage stakeholders and accelerate the development process is the best way to get buy-in for using this method. Failing that, many teams use something akin to a 'wagile' process where phases are created for external stakeholders while a more agile method is used internally.

## Recommended Tools
* [JIRA ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is the defacto standard for agile project management. It's hugely powerful but cumbersome for all but the largest development projects.
* [Trello](https://trello.com) is a fantastic agile task organization tool. It's a lighter, easier version of agile that adheres to the Kanban philosophy very closely.
* For waterfall projects, the standard is [MS Project](https://products.office.com/en-us/Project/project-and-portfolio-management-software). It generates the cascading gantt charts that have come to define project management for many folks.
* [Merlin](http://projectwizards.net/en/products/merlin-project/what-is) on Mac is a nice MS Project alternative if you use a Mac.
